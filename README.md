## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure all Python dependencies are installed
- Check that `Pokemon.db` file exists in the same directory
- Verify Python version is 3.8 or higher

**Images not loading:**
- Check internet connection for online images
- Verify image files exist in `Images/` directory
- Some images may be missing from the database

**Performance issues:**
- Close other applications to free up RAM
- The application loads all Pokemon data on startup
- Consider using the search filters to reduce displayed data

**Database errors:**
- Ensure `Pokemon.db` is not corrupted
- Check file permissions
- Try running as administrator (Windows)

### Getting Help
- Check the console output for error messages
- Verify all required files are present
- Ensure Python path includes the application directory

## üìä Data Structure

The application uses a comprehensive SQLite database (`Pokemon.db`) containing:

- **Pokemon Data**: Basic information, stats, abilities
- **Move Data**: All moves with type, power, accuracy, PP
- **Evolution Data**: Evolution chains and requirements
- **Type Data**: Type effectiveness and weaknesses
- **Location Data**: Where to find Pokemon in different games
- **Image Data**: URLs and file paths for Pokemon images
- **Breeding Data**: Egg groups, compatibility, breeding mechanics

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Colors
The application uses a custom theme system. Colors can be modified in the `setup_custom_theme()` method:

```python
# Main theme colors
style.configure('Custom.TFrame', background='#8B0000')  # Dark red
style.configure('ChartStats.TLabelframe', background='#000080')  # Navy blue
```

### Database Configuration
- Database file: `Pokemon.db`
- Connection: Automatic on startup
- Schema: Pre-defined SQLite tables

## üìà Performance Notes

- **Startup Time**: Initial load may take a few seconds due to data processing
- **Memory Usage**: ~100-200MB depending on system and data loaded
- **Image Loading**: Images are loaded asynchronously to prevent UI freezing
- **Search Performance**: Real-time filtering is optimized for large datasets

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Type Effectiveness Calculations
- Visual display of weaknesses and resistances
- Support for dual-type Pokemon

### Evolution Requirements
- Detailed evolution conditions
- Level requirements, items needed
- Time-based and location-based evolutions

### Move Learning Methods
